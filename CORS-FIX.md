# CORS Configuration Fix for Render Deployment

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Current Render Frontend URL
- Added `https://nexus-frontend-3dcx.onrender.com` to allowed origins list

### 2. Added Render URL Pattern Support
- Added `.onrender.com` pattern matching to allow ALL Render URLs
- This means any frontend deployed on Render will work automatically
- Updated both the `cors` middleware and manual CORS header middleware

### 3. Added Control Panel URL Support
- Added support for `CONTROL_PANEL_URL` environment variable
- Control Panel URL can now be set via environment variable in Render

### 4. Updated Both CORS Middlewares
- Updated the `cors` package configuration
- Updated the manual CORS header middleware for consistency

## How It Works Now

The backend now allows requests from:
1. **Hardcoded URLs:**
   - All localhost ports (for development)
   - pakistanonlines.com
   - Existing Railway URLs
   - Existing Render URLs

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - `FRONTEND_URL` - For custom frontend URLs
   - `CONTROL_PANEL_URL` - For Control Panel URL

3. **Pattern Matching:**
   - All `.railway.app` URLs
   - All `.up.railway.app` URLs
   - All `.onrender.com` URLs (NEW)

## Next Steps

### Optional: Set Environment Variables in Render Backend

If you want to explicitly set frontend URLs via environment variables:

1. Go to your Render backend service dashboard
2. Navigate to **Environment** tab
3. Add optional environment variables:
   - `FRONTEND_URL`: `https://nexus-frontend-3dcx.onrender.com`
   - `CONTROL_PANEL_URL`: `https://your-control-panel.onrender.com`

**Note:** These are optional since `.onrender.com` pattern matching will automatically allow all Render URLs.

## Testing

After deploying the updated backend:

1. Check backend logs for CORS messages:
   - `âœ… CORS allowed for origin: ...` means CORS is working
   - `ðŸš« CORS blocked origin: ...` means something is wrong

2. Test frontend:
   - Open browser console
   - Should see successful API calls
   - No CORS errors

3. Test Control Panel:
   - Should also work if deployed on Render

## Important Notes

- The pattern matching for `.onrender.com` means you don't need to update the backend every time you deploy a new frontend/control panel
- The backend will automatically allow any Render URL
- Environment variables are still useful for non-Render deployments or custom domains
